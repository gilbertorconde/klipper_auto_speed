# Better Auto Speed

Klipper module for automatically calculating your printer's maximum acceleration/velocity

_With one copy/paste and one line in your configuration, automatically optimize your printer's motion_

> **Disclaimer — improved, independently-maintained version**
>
> This is an enhanced version of Klipper Auto Speed, built on top of the original project created by [Anonoei](https://github.com/Anonoei/klipper_auto_speed). Full credit for the original idea and implementation belongs to the original author.
>
> This is a **separate, branched project — not a fork intended to upstream changes back** to the original repository. It is maintained independently at [gilbertorconde/klipper_auto_speed](https://github.com/gilbertorconde/klipper_auto_speed) and layers additional features and fixes on top of the original, including:
>
> - Per-axis motor current overrides (`X_CURRENT` / `Y_CURRENT` / `Z_CURRENT`)
> - Per-axis homing-speed overrides (`X_HOMING_SPEED` / `Y_HOMING_SPEED` / `Z_HOMING_SPEED`)
> - Size-aware acceleration/velocity search bounds derived from each axis's usable travel
> - Saving recommended results back to your printer config (`SAVE=1`)

This module automatically performs movements on the _x_, _y_, _x-diagonal_, _y-diagonal_, and _z_ axes, and measures your steppers missed steps at various accelerations/velocities.
With the default configuration, this may take _awhile_ (~10 minutes).
Most of the testing time is waiting for your printer to home.
On my printer with default settings (except MAX_MISSED), it takes ~3.5 minutes for acceleration, and ~5 minutes for velocity.

**Sensorless homing**: If you're using sensorless homing `MAX_MISSED=1.0` is probably too low.
The endstop variance check will tell you how many steps you lose when homing.
For instance, on my printer I lose around 0-4.2 steps each home.
I run `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED MAX_MISSED=10.0` to account for that variance, and occasional wildly different endstop results.

**This module is under development**, and has only been validated on CoreXY printers: You may run into issues or bugs, feel free to post an issue on this repository.

Your printer shouldn't have any crashes due to the movement patterns used, and re-homing before/after each test, so it's safe to walk away and let it do it's thing.

Using Ellis' pattern (BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_VALIDATE) is **NOT** a safe movement pattern. Please ensure your toolhead isn't crashing before walking away.

## Example Usage

- Default usage (find max accel/velocity)
  - `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED`
- Find maximum acceleration on y axis
  - `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_ACCEL AXIS="y"`
- Find maximum acceleration on y, then x axis
  - `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_VELOCITY AXIS="y,x"`
- Validate your printer's current accel/velocity (Ellis' test pattern)
  - `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_VALIDATE`
- Graph your printer's max velocity/accel
  - `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_GRAPH`
- Graph your printer's max velocity/accel between v100 and v1000, over 9 steps
  - `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_GRAPH VELOCITY_MIN=100 VELOCITY_MAX=1000 VELOCITY_DIV=9`

## Roadmap

- [ ] Export printer results as a 'benchmark' to a database to see average speeds for different printers
- [ ] Make \_ACCEL/\_VELOCITY smarter, based on printer size
- [ ] Add support for running through moonraker (enables scripting different commands, arguments)
- [x] Save validated/measured results to printer config (like SAVE_CONFIG)
- [ ] Couple ACCEL/VELOCITY similar to BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_GRAPH
  - [ ] Add BETTER_AUTO_SPEED ACCEL=10000 - to find what velocity lets you use accel 10000
  - [ ] Add BETTER_AUTO_SPEED VELOC=500 - to find what accel lets you use velocity 500
  - [ ] Make BETTER_AUTO_SPEED measure different accels/velocity to find the best values based on printer size
- [x] Variable motor current
- [x] Variable homing speed
- [x] Add testing Z axis
- [x] Reduce code duplication
- [x] Check kinematics to find best movement patterns
- [x] Update calculated accel/velocity depending on test to be more accurate
- [x] Update axis movement logic

## How does it work?

1.  Home your printer
2.  If your print is enclosed, heat soak it. You want to run this module in the typical state your printer is in when you're printing.
3.  Run `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED`
    1. Prepare
       1. Make sure the printer is level
       2. Check endstop variance
          - Validate the endstops are accurate enough for `MAX_MISSED`
    2. Find the maximum acceleration
       - Perform a binary search between `ACCEL_MIN` and `ACCEL_MAX`
       1. Home, and save stepper start steps
       2. Perform the movement check on the specified axis
       3. Home, and save stepper stop steps
       4. If difference between start/stop steps is more than `max_missed`, go to next step
    3. Find maximum velocity
       - Perform a binary search between `VELOCITY_MIN` and `VELOCITY_MAX`
       1. Home, and save stepper start steps
       2. Perform the movement check on the specified axis
       3. Home, and save stepper stop steps
       4. If difference between start/stop steps is more than `max_missed`, go to next step
    4. Show results

```
[better_auto_speed]
#axis: diag_x, diag_y  ; One or multiple of `x`, `y`, `diag_x`, `diag_y`, `z`

### Macro

Better Auto Speed is split into 5 separate macros. The default `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED` automatically calls the other three (`BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_ACCEL`, `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_VELOCITY`, `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_VALIDATE`). You can use any argument from those macros when you call `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED`.

You can also use `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_GRAPH` to find your printers velocity-to-accel relationship.

#### BETTER_AUTO_SPEED

`BETTER_AUTO_SPEED` finds maximum acceleration, velocity, and validates results at the end.

On CoreXY (`corexy`/`hybrid_corexy`/`markforged`) the A/B motors share current: a single `X_CURRENT` or `Y_CURRENT` is applied to both `stepper_x` and `stepper_y`; passing both with different values is allowed but warns. Current applies to every motor on an axis (e.g. dual/quad Z). Homing speed is always per-axis.

**Size-aware search bounds:** When you don't set them explicitly, the accel/velocity search bounds are derived per-axis from that axis's usable travel rather than fixed constants. The velocity ceiling is `sqrt(accel_max * travel)` (e.g. ~3464 mm/s on a 120 mm axis, ~7071 mm/s on a 500 mm axis), and the accel floor scales from travel when a fixed `VELOCITY` is supplied. `velocity_min` and `accel_max` are not travel-bounded and keep their defaults. Any value you set explicitly (config option or macro argument) always overrides the computed default. This is a behavior change from earlier fixed defaults (5000 mm/s, etc.); set `velocity_max`/`accel_min`/etc. explicitly to restore fixed values.

#### BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_VALIDATE

ACCEL | Unset | Defaults to current max accel
VELOCITY | Unset | Defaults to current max velocity
X_CURRENT | Unset | Motor run-current (A) applied to X during the run, restored after (requires TMC drivers)
Y_CURRENT | Unset | Motor run-current (A) applied to Y during the run, restored after (requires TMC drivers)
Z_CURRENT | Unset | Motor run-current (A) applied to Z during the run, restored after (requires TMC drivers)

Y_HOMING_SPEED | Unset | Homing speed (mm/s) applied to Y during the run, restored after
Z_HOMING_SPEED | Unset | Homing speed (mm/s) applied to Z during the run, restored after

## Console Output

Console output is slightly different depending on whether testing acceleration/velocity, and which axis is being tested.

- `axis` is one of `x`, `y`, `diag_x`, `diag_y`, `z`
- The three times after `after` are (first home time)/(movement time)/(end home time)
- `#`s before decimals are variable, `#`s after decimals are static
