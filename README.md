This module automatically performs movements on the _x_, _y_, _x-diagonal_, _y-diagonal_, and _z_ axes, and measures your steppers missed steps at various accelerations/velocities.
With the default configuration, this may take _awhile_ (~10 minutes).
Most of the testing time is waiting for your printer to home.
On my printer with default settings (except MAX_MISSED), it takes ~3.5 minutes for acceleration, and ~5 minutes for velocity.

**Sensorless homing**: If you're using sensorless homing `MAX_MISSED=1.0` is probably too low.
The endstop variance check will tell you how many steps you lose when homing.
For instance, on my printer I lose around 0-4.2 steps each home.
I run `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED MAX_MISSED=10.0` to account for that variance, and occasional wildly different endstop results.

**This module is under development**, and has only been validated on CoreXY printers: You may run into issues or bugs, feel free to post an issue on this repository.

Your printer shouldn't have any crashes due to the movement patterns used, and re-homing before/after each test, so it's safe to walk away and let it do it's thing.

Using Ellis' pattern (BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_VALIDATE) is **NOT** a safe movement pattern. Please ensure your toolhead isn't crashing before walking away.

## How does it work?

1.  Home your printer
2.  If your print is enclosed, heat soak it. You want to run this module in the typical state your printer is in when you're printing.
3.  Run `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED`
    1. Prepare
       1. Make sure the printer is level
       2. Check endstop variance
          - Validate the endstops are accurate enough for `MAX_MISSED`
    2. Find the maximum acceleration
       - Perform a binary search between `ACCEL_MIN` and `ACCEL_MAX`
       1. Home, and save stepper start steps
       2. Perform the movement check on the specified axis
       3. Home, and save stepper stop steps
       4. If difference between start/stop steps is more than `max_missed`, go to next step
    3. Find maximum velocity
       - Perform a binary search between `VELOCITY_MIN` and `VELOCITY_MAX`
       1. Home, and save stepper start steps
       2. Perform the movement check on the specified axis
       3. Home, and save stepper stop steps
       4. If difference between start/stop steps is more than `max_missed`, go to next step
    4. Show results

## Using Better Auto Speed

### Moonraker Update Manager

```
[update_manager klipper_auto_speed]
type: git_repo
path: ~/klipper_auto_speed
origin: https://github.com/gilbertorconde/klipper_auto_speed.git
primary_branch: main
install_script: install.sh
managed_services: klipper
```

### Installation

To install this module you need to clone the repository and run the `install.sh` script.
**Depending on when you installed klipper, you may also need to [update your klippy-env python version.](https://github.com/gilbertorconde/klipper_auto_speed#update-klippy-env)**

#### Automatic installation

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/gilbertorconde/klipper_auto_speed.git
cd klipper_auto_speed
./install.sh
```

#### Manual installation

1.  Clone the repository
    1. `cd ~`
    2. `git clone https://github.com/gilbertorconde/klipper_auto_speed.git`
    3. `cd klipper_auto_speed`
2.  Link better_auto_speed to klipper
    1. `ln -sf ~/klipper_auto_speed/better_auto_speed ~/klipper/klippy/extras/better_auto_speed`
3.  Install matplotlib
    1.  `~/klippy-env/bin/python -m pip install matplotlib`
4.  Restart klipper
    1. `sudo systemctl restart klipper`

#### Update klippy-env

The installer checks the Python used by Klipper's virtual environment (`~/klippy-env/bin/python`), not your system `python3`. If that env still uses Python 2, recreate/upgrade it:

1.  `sudo apt install python3`
2.  `sudo apt install python3-numpy`
3.  `sudo systemctl stop klipper`
4.  `python3 -m venv --upgrade ~/klippy-env`
5.  `~/klippy-env/bin/pip install -r "~/klipper/scripts/klippy-requirements.txt"`

Check the env's Python version with `~/klippy-env/bin/python --version`.

#### Uninstallation

Run the `uninstall.sh` script to remove the module from Klipper:

```
cd ~/klipper_auto_speed
./uninstall.sh
```

It removes the `better_auto_speed` link from `~/klipper/klippy/extras` and restarts Klipper. Afterwards, delete the `[better_auto_speed]` section (and any `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED`-saved values) from your `printer.cfg`, then restart Klipper once more.

### Configuration

Place this in your printer.cfg

```
[better_auto_speed]
```

The values listed below are the defaults Better Auto Speed uses. You can include them if you wish to change their values or run into issues.

```
[better_auto_speed]
#axis: diag_x, diag_y  ; One or multiple of `x`, `y`, `diag_x`, `diag_y`, `z`

#margin: 20            ; How far away from your axes to perform movements

#settling_home: 1      ; Perform settling home before starting Better Auto Speed
#max_missed: 1.0       ; Maximum full steps that can be missed
#endstop_samples: 3    ; How many endstop samples to take for endstop variance

#accel_min: 1000.0     ; Minimum acceleration test may try
#accel_max: 50000.0    ; Maximum acceleration test may try
#accel_accu: 0.05      ; Keep binary searching until the result is within this percentage

#velocity_min: 50.0    ; Minimum velocity test may try
#velocity_max: 5000.0  ; Maximum velocity test may try
#velocity_accu: 0.05   ; Keep binary searching until the result is within this percentage

#derate: 0.8           ; Derate discovered results by this amount

#z_position_speed: 25  ; Speed (mm/s) for positioning moves that change Z, e.g. centering/Z= move. Keeps belted/Trident Z from slamming after leveling
#motor_off: 0          ; Issue M84 (disable steppers) once the run finishes

#validate_margin: Unset      ; Margin for VALIDATE, Defaults to margin
#validate_inner_margin: 20.0 ; Margin for VALIDATE inner pattern
#validate_iterations: 50     ; Perform VALIDATE pattern this many times

#results_dir: ~/printer_data/config ; Destination directory for graphs
```

> [!WARNING]
> If your Z axis is homed with a probe / virtual endstop (e.g. Klipper Tap, or `endstop_pin: probe:z_virtual_endstop`), missed-step detection on Z is unreliable. Better Auto Speed will warn you, and any Z results may be over-optimistic — treat them with caution.

### Macro

Better Auto Speed is split into 5 separate macros. The default `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED` automatically calls the other three (`BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_ACCEL`, `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_VELOCITY`, `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_VALIDATE`). You can use any argument from those macros when you call `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED`.

You can also use `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_GRAPH` to find your printers velocity-to-accel relationship.

#### BETTER_AUTO_SPEED

`BETTER_AUTO_SPEED` finds maximum acceleration, velocity, and validates results at the end.

On CoreXY (`corexy`/`hybrid_corexy`/`markforged`) the A/B motors share current: a single `X_CURRENT` or `Y_CURRENT` is applied to both `stepper_x` and `stepper_y`; passing both with different values is allowed but warns. Current applies to every motor on an axis (e.g. dual/quad Z). Homing speed is always per-axis.

##### Coupling acceleration and velocity

Acceleration and velocity are not independent: within a fixed travel distance, a higher acceleration leaves less room to reach a high cruise velocity and vice versa. `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED` can account for this in three ways:

- **`ACCEL=<value>`** holds that acceleration fixed and searches for the velocity that works with it (the acceleration search is skipped). Answers "what velocity can I use at this accel?"
- **`VELOC=<value>`** (alias `VELOCITY`) holds that velocity fixed and searches for the acceleration that works with it. Answers "what accel can I use at this velocity?"
- **`COUPLE=1`** sweeps `VELOCITY_DIV` cruise velocities between the (size-aware) velocity bounds, measures the maximum acceleration that passes at each (like `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_GRAPH`, per axis), then recommends the single accel/velocity pair with the highest throughput.

The throughput metric is the time of a representative point-to-point move sized to your printer (the shortest tested axis travel), using the standard trapezoidal/triangular motion model (`t = v/a + D/v`, or `2*sqrt(D/a)` when the move never reaches cruise). The pair with the lowest move time wins. When multiple axes are tested, the acceleration at each velocity is the minimum measured across axes so the recommended pair is safe everywhere. `DERATE` is applied to the recommended values, and `SAVE=1`/`VALIDATE=1` work as usual. The sweep runs a full acceleration search at every velocity, so it takes considerably longer than a single `BETTER_AUTO_SPEED` run.

#### BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_ACCEL

**Size-aware search bounds:** When you don't set them explicitly, the accel/velocity search bounds are derived per-axis from that axis's usable travel rather than fixed constants. The velocity ceiling is `sqrt(accel_max * travel)` (e.g. ~3464 mm/s on a 120 mm axis, ~7071 mm/s on a 500 mm axis), and the accel floor scales from travel when a fixed `VELOCITY` is supplied. `velocity_min` and `accel_max` are not travel-bounded and keep their defaults. Any value you set explicitly (config option or macro argument) always overrides the computed default. This is a behavior change from earlier fixed defaults (5000 mm/s, etc.); set `velocity_max`/`accel_min`/etc. explicitly to restore fixed values.

#### BETTER_AUTO_SPEED_VALIDATE

## Console Output

Console output is slightly different depending on whether testing acceleration/velocity, and which axis is being tested.

- `axis` is one of `x`, `y`, `diag_x`, `diag_y`, `z`
- The three times after `after` are (first home time)/(movement time)/(end home time)
- `#`s before decimals are variable, `#`s after decimals are static
